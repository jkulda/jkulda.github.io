Computing tools for visualisation and analysis of atomic scale models of crystalline solids. Fast generation of elastic and inelastic neutron and Xray diffuse scattering intensity maps in the momentum-energy space (Q,w) based the non-uniform fast Fourier transform of input data from molecular dynamics (MD), phasefield (Ferrodo) and lattice defect (Discus) simulations. Complementary pair distribution function (PDF) and vibrational density of states (DOS) computation.
